# Hi there, I'm Amraj 👋
Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm a computer engineering student with a passion for software development, robotics, and everything tech-related. Here's a bit about me:

- 🎓 Currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia (UBC)
+ 🚀 Software Developer at Subbots, where I get to work on some pretty cool stuff like developing autonomous navigation and enhancing robotic movements.
* 💻 Proficient in Java, C, C++, Python, and more. I love exploring new programming languages and technologies.
+ 🏆 Projects I've worked on include a Twitter Pheme Server, Dancing Robot, Autonomous Claw, Kamino Game, and a 16-bit RISC machine.
- 🌟 Other experiences include being an assistant manager at Joe's BBQ Boat (yes, it's as awesome as it sounds), and holding a Pleasure Craft Operator Card (for all your boating needs!)

### What I'm Working On
#### *🌊Autonomous Submarine🌊*
Currently, I am working with a team for developing an autonomous submarine that can navigate and perform tasks without human intervention. My current goal is to improve its object detection abilities, specifically to detect objects and draw a square shape around them. This involves working with sensors and developing algorithms to process and interpret the data received.
#### *🐶IntelliFeeder🐱*
I'm also working on a project called IntelliFeeder, which is a pet feeder that uses machine learning to differentiate between dogs and cats and provide the correct food. As it stands, the IntelliFeeder consists of a double-channelled chassis design, where each channel houses the pet food for the cat and the dog. The feeder will have a servo-controlled flap for precise food dispensing and will be controlled by a microcontroller. I'm developing a web app to interface with the IntelliFeeder, allowing users to view the food log and access the camera. The app will be built using ReactJS or VueJS and hosted on a web server (likely using Flask) to send/receive data to the IntelliFeeder. 

### My Goals🎯
As a computer engineering student, I'm constantly fascinated by the potential of technology to make a positive impact on society. My ultimate goal is to use my knowledge and skills to help improve people's lives by leveraging the power of the online world. I believe that technology can play a huge role in solving some of the world's biggest challenges, from climate change to healthcare access. I want to be a part of that positive change, and I hope to work on projects that reflect these values.
